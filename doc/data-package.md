# Data Packages

A Data Package (or DataPackage) is a simple way of "packaging" up data.

To create a Data Package, all you need to do is place a "descriptor" file named
`datapackage.json` in the top-level directory of your set of data files.

#### Why Data Packages? How Can They Help?

Imagine a situation such as the following:

* You have a set of data files in a directory (and subdirectories) - whether
  locally or online
* You want to provide basic info for this collection (the "dataset") - perhaps
  you want to publish this data for others, or simply to manage it better
  yourself
* Information like: author, license, list of files in the dataset (and possibly
  info on those files, like a schema)

The Data Package approach provides a **very simple**, **web friendly**, 
**standardized** and **extensible**, way for you to do this.

## Getting Started

A minimal example Data Package would look like this on disk:

    datapackage.json
    # a data file (CSV in this case but could be any type of data)
    data.csv
    # (Optional!) A README (in markdown format)
    README.md

Any number of additional files such as more data files, scripts (for processing
or analyzing the data) and other material may be provided but are not required.

## datapackage.json

`datapackage.json` is the file that makes a Data Package a Data Package
(and is the only required file). It provides:

* General metadata such as the name of the package, its license, its publisher
  etc
* A "manifest" in the the form of a list of the data resources (data files)
  included in this data package along with information on those files (e.g.
  size and schema)
    
As its file extension indicates it must be a [JSON][] file. Here's a very
minimal example of a `datapackage.json` file:

    {
      "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
      "title": "A nice title",
      "resources": [{
        # see below for what a resource descriptor looks like
      }]
    }

[JSON]: http://www.json.org/

Here is a much more extensive example of a datapackage JSON file:

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** a complete list of potential attributes and their meaning can be found in the
[full Data Package spec][spec].
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** the Data Package format is **extensible** in that it allows you add
your own attributes to the `datapackage.json`
</div>

    {
      "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
      "datapackage_version": "1.0-beta",
      "title": "A nice title",
      "description": "...",
      "version": "2.0",
      "keywords": ["name", "My new keyword"],
      "licenses": [{
        "url": "http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/",
        "name": "Open Data Commons Public Domain",
        "version": "1.0",
        "id": "odc-pddl"
      }]
      "sources": [{
        "name": "World Bank and OECD",
        "web": "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"

        "email": "joe@bloggs.com",
        "web": "http://www.bloggs.com"
      }],
      "maintainers": [{
        # like contributors
      }],
      "publishers": [{
        # like contributors
      }],
      "dependencies": {
        "data-package-name": ">=1.0"
      },
      "resources": [
        {
          ... see below ...
        }
      ],
      # this is an attribute that is not part of the data package spec
      # you can add your own attributes to a datapackage.json
      "my-own-attribute": "data-packages-are-awesome"
    }

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

You list data files in the resources entry of the datapackage.json.

    {
      # one of url or path should be present (you can have both)
      path: "relative-path-to-file" # e.g. data/mydata.csv
      url: "online url" # e.g http://mysite.org/some-data.csv
    }

## Tools

There is a growing set of [online and offline tools][tools] for working with Data
Packages including tools for creating, viewing, validating, publishing and
managing Data Packages. See the [Data Package tools page for more][tools].

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

Many exemplar data packages can be found in the [datasets organization on
github][datasets]. Specific examples:

### [World GDP][]

A Data Package which includes the data locally in the repo (data is CSV).

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/gdp/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### [S&P 500 Companies Data][sp500]

[sp500]: https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies

This is an example with more than one resource in the data package.

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### [TopoJSON example][topojson]

This data package has TopoJSON and the data is external to the repo.

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/ex-topojson/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

[datasets]: https://github.com/datasets
[World GDP]: https://github.com/datasets/gdp 
[ISO 3166-2 country codes]: https://github.com/datasets/country-codes
[topojson]: https://github.com/datasets/ex-topojson
